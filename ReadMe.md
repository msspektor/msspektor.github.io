This it the GitHub repository of my academic website. You can access it via [mikhail.spektor.ch](http://mikhail.spektor.ch) or [msspektor.github.io](https://msspektor.github.io).

The site is build with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with a slightly modified theme based on [Agency bootstrap theme ](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/) and the 5th EADM summer school website at [ldmss.org](http://ldmss.org) .
